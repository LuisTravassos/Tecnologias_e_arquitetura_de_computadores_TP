Word Search Game in Assembly 8086

This project was developed as part of the course "Computer Technologies and Architecture". Throughout the semester, we used Assembly 8086 language and available resources to create a version of the word search game. In this version, the user can play directly in the DOSBox environment using some keys on the keyboard.
Objective

The main objective of this project was to enhance our programming skills in Assembly 8086 and deepen our understanding of low-level operations, very close to the hardware. Developing this version of the word search game provided a unique opportunity to work at a machine-level, promoting a deeper understanding of computer architecture.
Features
